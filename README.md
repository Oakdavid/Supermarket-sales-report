Supermarket Sales Performance Report – Excel Project

Project Overview
This Excel-based project simulates a Supermarket Sales Report for a retail business with multiple branches. The objective was to clean raw sales data and analyze performance using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. Although these visuals are not yet combined into a single dashboard view, they are fully dynamic and refreshable.

Used Pivot Charts to visualize:
~ Revenue distribution across categories (Bar chart)

~ Store comparison (Column chart)

Refresh & Automation
Added new sales entries to the raw data
Refreshed Power Query and Pivot Tables to ensure dynamic updates
Verified that all visuals and summaries were updated correctly

Key Insights

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a real-world workflow for an entry-level data analyst using Excel. It covers end-to-end analysis from raw data to automated insights, laying a strong foundation for future reporting and dashboarding using tools like Power BI.
